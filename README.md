Download bulk images/videos from MRM. Nobody asks for it but here we go...

## Feature

- Download bulk images from one page
- Download Video
- That's it lmao

## Usage

- Install Tampermonkey or any extension that supports userscript.

- Visit [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/507784-mrm-downloader) and click on install or Install from the [GitHub](https://github.com/NYT92/mrm-downloader/raw/refs/heads/main/mrm.user.js) directly

- When you install the script, it will tell you that "A userscript wants to access a cross-origin resource". Since the script relies on GM_cookie & GM_xmlhttpRequest, Click __Allow all__ to use the script properly.

This script has nothing to do with myreadingmanga.info and all of the mangas, doujin, and animation there. The script's purpose is to download those files for personal archival only, but if you have money, go ahead and support all of these artists.
