## Adblocker (off topic)
If you use any adblocker, myreadingmanga will not work and it is not our script that causes the problem. The problem is that the adblocker blocks the main important URL that accesses those resources. 
To fix this for the uBlock origin user simply go to the `settings > my filter` and add those rules in and apply.
